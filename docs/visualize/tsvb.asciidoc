[[TSVB]]
== Visualizing your data with TSVB

TSVB is a time series data visualizer that allows you to use the full power of the 
Elasticsearch aggregation framework. With TSVB, you can combine an infinite 
number of aggregations to display complex data.

NOTE: In Elasticsearch version 7.3.0 and later, the time series data visualizer is now referred to as TSVB instead of Time Series Visual Builder.

TSVB comes with these types of visualizations:

<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
Time Series::
A histogram visualization that supports area, line, bar, and steps along with 
<<<<<<< HEAD
multiple y-axis. Fully customize the colors, points, line thickness, and fill 
opacity. Compare two time periods by using time shifting, and use annotations 
that are loaded from a separate index based on a query.

==== Metric

A visualization that displays the latest number in a series. With the Metric 
visualization, you can use a primary and secondary metric, and customize the 
labels and backgrounds based on a set of rules.

[[create-tsvb-visualization]]
=== Create TSVB visualizations

To create a TSVB visualization, choose the data series you want to display, then choose how you want to display the data. The options available are dependent on the visualization.

[float]
[[tsvb-data-series-options]]
=== Configure the data series

To create a single metric, add multiple data series with multiple aggregations.

. Select the visualization type.

. Specify the data series labels and colors.

.. Select *Data*.
+ 
If you are using the *Table* visualization, select *Columns*.

.. In the *Label* field, enter a name for the data series, which is used on legends and titles.
+
For series that are grouped by a term, you can specify a mustache variable of `{{key}}` to substitute the term.

.. If supported by the visualization, click the swatch and choose a color for the data series.

.. To add another data series, click *+*, then repeat the steps to specify the labels and colors.

. Specify the data series metrics.

.. Select *Metrics*.

.. From the dropdown lists, choose your options.

.. To add another metric, click *+*.
+
When you add more than one metric, the last metric value is displayed, which is indicated by the eye icon. 

. To specify the format and display options, select *Options*.

. To specify how to group or split the data, choose an option from the *Group by* drop down list.
+
By default, the data series are grouped by everything.
